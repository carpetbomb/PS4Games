# PS4Games

First off I'd like to thank you guys for the support I've received regarding this project.
Initially I made this for myself because I wanted to see which games were newly added to a site - but then I had the idea of sharing it here to see how people reacted.
Since everyone seems to like it I have decided to release it!

If you'd like to donate at all to give me incentive to work on it more feel free to do so at my paypal

# Installation

First things first you're gonna need Python, you can get it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Once you've got python installed open up the 'requirements.txt' file and press CTRL+A CTRL+C (copy the whole document)
Open up Command Prompt and CTRL+V (paste)

To run the program use 'run.vbs' or 'python zbombr115s_PS4_Games_List.py'

# Bugs

Please DM me with any bugs you find and I'll try my best to fix them in a timely manner.
-I know the Size calculation isn't always right, that's partially lazy programming on my part
It's possible for the site to pseudo-rate-limit you if you make too many requests but this can be avoided by not spam-updating the games list.
